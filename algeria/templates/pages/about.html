            <p class="description" style="text-align: left;" > The goal of the Algeria Research Hub is to spark innovation and catalyze private sector growth in Algeria by increasing collaboration
                and research capacity in Algerian universities and within the private sector. Initially, the Research Hub will focus on four primary 
                areas of study: Artificial Intelligence (AI), Applied Mathematics, Applied Science (including clean energy), and Agriculture. 
                The Pulte Institute for Global Development at the University of Notre Dame is working with Algerian university partners, including the 
                Higher Schools of Artificial Intelligence and Mathematics at Sidi Abdellah and the Center for Development of Advanced Technologies (CDTA), to:
                <ul>
                  <li class="description " style="text-align: left;">  Increase cooperation among higher education, civil society, and the private sector to promote socio-economic innovation;</li>
                
                  <li class="description" style="text-align: left;">  Increase the capacity of higher education centers to engage in innovative and market-based research.</li>
                
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="description"  style="text-align: left;">Among the planned activities, the Research Hub intends to develop a research methods curriculum to improve research capacity, 
                link Algerian researchers to mentors in Algeria and the US, provide a research administration support curriculum and implement a workshop
                 residency program. This website will serve as a virtual platform to access training materials, research support literature, other research
                methodology materials, funding notices and opportunities, Algerian and international research collaboration calls, and case studies.
                </p>
                <p class="description"  style="text-align: left;">
                In the project's first visit to Algeria in June 2022, Notre Dame faculty from the <a href="https://lucyinstitute.nd.edu/">Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society</a>  and the
                 <a href="https://ideacenter.nd.edu/">Notre Dame Innovation, De-Risking and Enterprise Acceleration (IDEA) Center</a> provided presentations on their institutes' work and pedagogy.
                 These presentations and others can be found on the  <a href="resourcePage.html">Resource Page</a>. The Algeria Research Hub hopes to bring faculty
                   from Notre Dame in early December 2022 to share information, best practices, and pedagogy related to commercialization and applied math. 
                   Next quarter the project also hopes to host an events section, a photo gallery, and a collaborative networking space on this virtual
                 portal.
                
                 
                
                The Algeria Research Hub is funded by the US Department of State and the US Embassy in Algiers.
